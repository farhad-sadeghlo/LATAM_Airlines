On helpful approach would be to separate national and international flights to different datasets, so, we can observe delayed times better 


From airports.csv I can have the geolocation of the airports and then plot GeoChoropleth of airports, adding weather data maybe I can derive why delayed happened.

ML Analysis

We can get rid of flight number, origin, and destination cities as they are too specific.


Since being on-time matters so I would consider being > 15 as being abs() > 15


For morning, afternoon and night, and also other classes from other columns use one-hot encoding 


y is the last column either it is a delay or not


Predicting minutes delayed and also predicting if the flight is delayed or not delayed.

	for this We would feed all numerical columns as x and the delayed time in minutes as y


Classifying flights if its delayed or not
	for this x can remain as only those numerical columns and the delayed time as 1 delayed or 0 not delayed
